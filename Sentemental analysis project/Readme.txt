DATA:

Emotion detection from text is one of the challenging problems in Natural Language Processing.The data is basically a collection of tweets annotated with the emotions behind them. We have Two columns text, sentiment. In "text" we have the raw tweet and in "sentiment", we have corresponding emotion. Task is given a raw text, predict the emotion/sentiment for it. 

The data that we have is having 13 different emotions. 

SUBMISSION:

TIP: You are free to use any libraries of your choice or write custom code. Also, you are allowed to do any offline processing that is required. Give as much thought as possible before you finalize on the solution. We suggest you fully utilize 24-hours to finish the task and not rush in giving a quick solution.

The format of the submission: Please send your code, also write a ReadMe file to explain your assumptions and reasoning behind choosing a particular technique.

Bonus points for:

    Clean, modular and readable code

    Sufficient comments (also don't overdo! :P)

    Efficient code (i.e., which executes fast)


Happy Coding :)
